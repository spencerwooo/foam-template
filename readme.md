> Personal adversarial examples and AI security knowledge base.

Welcome to Spencer's personal knowledge base.

I mainly focus on summarizing CVPR / ICLR and other computer vision / adversarial examples / GAN papers. There are also surveys on some topics that I am currently focused on.

## Notes

- [[iqa]] - Image Quality Assessment
- [[fgsm-other-norm]] - Extending FGSM to other norms
- [[cw-algorithm]] - The CW attack algorithm

## Papers

See more at: [[papers]].

## How's this generated?

What you are seeing now is basically a Jekyll site but with dedicated designs to incorporate the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) note taking / organizing scheme. This `workspace` is generated by [foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) and managed with both [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and VS Code with some plugins.

Foam is a personal knowledge management and sharing system inspired by Roam Research, built on Visual Studio Code and GitHub. I'm using Foam to manage my notes to create a web of re-discoverable notes.
